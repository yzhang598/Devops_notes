# Pros & Cons for different software architectures



|                           | Pros                                                         | Cons                                                         | Def                                                          |
| ------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Layered pattern**       | - Support incremental development.<br />- Layer can be reused.<br />- It is secure.<br />- Layers can help partition complex problems.<br />- The application is portable. | - Hard to clean separation layers.<br />- Multiple layers of processing maybe slow.<br />- Diffcult to sturcture some layer.<br />- Single point of failure. | The Layered pattern is a software architecture pattern in which the application is divided into layers, with each layer having a specific responsibility. |
| **Client-server pattern** | - It is secure.<br />- Adding new servers or updating servers is easy.<br />- Supports parallel implementation. | - If servers own by others, management problem <br />- Servers may get overloaded. <br />- Single point of failure. | The Client-Server pattern is a software architecture pattern in which a client application communicates with a server application over a network. |
| **Event-driven pattern**  | - The code execution is synchronous.<br />- Easy to implementation. | - Increase the complexity for API provider.<br />- Limit support | The Event-Driven pattern is a software architecture pattern in which the application responds to various events, such as user input, sensor readings, or messages from other systems. |
| **Microkernel pattern**   | - Easy for test different modules.<br />- Plug-in modules easy to deploy.<br />- Minimizing the change to the core. | - Not highly scalable.<br />- Require analysis before implementation. | The Microkernel pattern is a software architecture pattern in which the kernel of an operating system is kept as small as possible, providing only the basic services required for system operation. |
| **Microservices pattern** | - Scalability<br />- Smaller and faster deployments<br />- Ease of understanding<br />- Improved fault isolation | - Communicate between each services is hard.<br />- Global testing is difficult.<br />- Debugging is hard.<br />- Deployment challengers. | The Microservices pattern is a software architecture pattern in which a complex application is broken down into a collection of small, independent services. |
